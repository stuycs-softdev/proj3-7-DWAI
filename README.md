###Project:
Our project, temporarily dubbed Google Paint, was intended to be a version of Google Docs for arists. Multiple artists could collaborate on a drawing simultaneously, while having most of the basic features of more complex graphics programs available to them.
Although we do not yet have multiperson functionality working, we have a canvas that allows users to drawing, change their pen size and color, as well as undo and redo their strokes. Each user also has a gallery that lets them view images they have saved.
